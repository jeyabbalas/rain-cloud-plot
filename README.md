# Rain cloud plots

This repository contains the D3 code for the rain cloud plots. It was created using elemental plots including a density plot, a box plot, and a beeswarm plot. The only dependency is D3.js.

The main purpose of this repository was to teach myself how to deploy a D3 visualization project, built using an ES6 bundler (Vite.js), on GitHub pages.
